Sorting methods contains few kinds of sorting:
- bubble sort - robust algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n^2);
- cocktail sort - robust algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n^2);
- gnome sort - robust algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n^2);
- insertion sort - robust algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n^2);
- selection sort - unstable algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n^2);
- counting sort - robust algorithm, algorithm complexity - O(n+k).
